MEDIAWIKI INSTALLATION

mediawiki is a free 
Because my project is going to be a forum, i have decided to use mediawiki as my platform to allow users to create their own posts and share information.
mediawiki will allow me to collect and organise information, and make this public and available to people. 
I am using mediawiki because it is powerful, multilingual, free and open, extensible, customisable, reliable, and free of charge.
This is because it is a free software licensed under version 2 (or later version) of the GNU General Public License.

Steps to install mediawiki on the server.
Step 1.
Enter the command below into the terminal

wget https://releases.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.43/mediawiki-1.43.1.tar.gz

Step 2.
- Once the wikimedia file is downloaded, it will be stored as a .zip or a .zar.gz file format, this needs to be uncompressed to be used.
- you can check your working directory to see if the file is there

- use the command ls to check your working directory

- to uncompress this file use the command 

tar -szvf mediawiki-1.43.1.tar.gz

- the version of the mediawiki file may change, as such check your working directory to find which file to open.

- by using ls you can check if the file has been decompressed.

- use ls -lo to check the file and see the user permissions.

step 3.
- Since we are using apache and have already downloaded apache2 onto the server, 
- we need to move the mediawiki file to where your apache html directory is.
- the html directorhy is by default in the location /var/www/
- you can access this area by doing cd /var/www/ but do not this yet

- you need to move your mediawiki file into the /var/www/ directory. do this by using the command below

sudo mv mediawiki-1.43.1 /var/www/

after this, do the command cd /var/www/

- your directory should now look as shown below 

rootuser:/var/www$ ls
html  mediawiki-1.43.1

step 4.

- replace the html file with the mediawiki file, this will make the website display as mediawiki instead of the default apache2 html website.

- to change these files do the following commands 

sudo mv html oldapachehtml
sudo mv mediawiki-1.43.1 html

- now when you open your website, the webpage will display the mediawiki homepage instead of the apache2.

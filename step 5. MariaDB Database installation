- Since the project we are creating uses a forum, we need to download a forum so people can create user profiles and interact on the site.

- In this project, we download a opensouce database service called 

MariaDB

- MariaDB was created by the same developers as MySQL, and is designed to be a improvement, and a drop-in replacement for legacy MySQL systems.


- Use the steps below to install and enable MariaDB


Installing MariaDB

Step 1.
- install the mariadb package using the command below

sudo apt install mariadb-server

step 2.
- Ensure that MariaDB is running on the system using the commands below.

sudo systemctl start mariadb.service
sudo systemctl enable mariadb.service


Configuring MariaDB

Step 1.
- Run the included security script.

sudo mysql_secure_installation

- This command will ask the user multiple questions regarding their MariaDB database.

Q1. Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
A. press enter, do not set password for root user
Q2. Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n]
A. You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.
Q3. Change the root password? [Y/n]
A. You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.
Q4. Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]
A. Y
Q5. Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]
A. Y
Q6. Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]
A. Y
Q7. Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]
A. Y


Step 2. 
- Testing to see if MariaDB is installed properly.
- use the command below to find this information

sudo systemctl status mariadb

- The following will be displayed if marioadb is enabled and working properly

● mariadb.service - MariaDB 10.11.13 database server

- If MaraiDB is not running, use the command sudo systemstart mariadb to start the database

- If you want to obtain information regarding the version of MariaDB you are running use the command below

sudo mysqladmin version

- Information similar to below will be displayed.

Step 3.
Creating a account for MariaDB
- this will as an admin account for MariaDB, this is needed to store information dynamically through the program.
- this will be talked about later in step 8

Enter the following commandline

sudo mariadb

then enter the text below

CREATE DATABASE mywiki;
CREATE USER 'wikiuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'securepassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mywiki.* TO 'wikiuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

- The username and password is interchangable, this is just an example

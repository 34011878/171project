Setup MariaDB database
The following options will be displayed to you

MariaDB/MySQL settings
Q. Database host:
A. localhost
- Localhost is automatically declared, if the name localhost does not work use the local ip "127.0.0.1"

Connect over SSL
- this is a yes or no, if you select or do not select. i leave this unchecked as i am not connecting remotely, i am directly operating the local host

Identify this wiki
Q. Database name (no hyphens):
A. my_wiki
- The "Database name" field is asking for the name of the MaqiaDB database where the forum you created on MediaWiki will store all its pages, users, settings, etc.

Q. Database table prefix (no hyphens):
A. Leave this field blank, this is because we are only using one forum on the server so it makes it simpler.

User account for installation
Q. Database username:
A. root
- the database username is asking for the MariaDB user that the forum mediawiki will use connect to MariaDB, create tables, manage data.
- Because of this leaving it as the root username is simple as we control it as the admin.

Database password:
A. leave this field blank
- this is because, unless another user is logged into the EC2 instance, they cannot access this, you cannot access the database remotely.

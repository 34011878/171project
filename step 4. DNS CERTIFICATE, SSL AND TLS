DOMAIN NAME SERVICE (DNS)

INFORMATION BELOW, CAN SKIP IF ONLY WANT TO SETUP.


The domain name services are used to make the websites url look more user-friendly.
instead of a ip address, it can be a memorable name such as minecraft.com
Obtain a domain name through a service provider e.g. noip.com, godaddy.com


Once a DNS is created, we will link the ec2 amazon instance to the domain name you just created.
After the domain name has been linked to ec2, you can make your website more secure by making traffic enter through.
HTTPS instead of the default HTTP, HTTPS is on port 443 and HTTP is on port 80.

Certbot is going to be used for this process. 
Certbot allows the dns you will link to the public IP of your ecs allowing the website to recieve a certificate.
certbot is a tool that will automatically sets up SSL/TLS certificates for your website using Letâ€™s Encrypt.

without certbot, the website will only recieve traffic through port 80 as HTTP, this traffic is not encrypted
which means that traffic can be vulnerable to hackers as the site is not secure.

With certbot, the website will recieve traffic through port 443 as HTTPS, this traffic is encrypted between the webbrowser
and the server which it is hosted on, this website will now be displayed as secure with a padlock to confirm the certificate.



SETUP STEPS

Register a domain name through your desired provider, you will then need to link it to your EC2 connection through the commands below.
these steps can be seen on the certbot.eff.org website, or by following as shown below.

step 1. 
Install Snapd.
Snapd is a background service that manages and runs snap packages on the ununtu instance.
Use the following commands to install Snapd
sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install core
sudo snap refresh core


step 2. 
- remove potential certbot instances on the server through the command

sudo apt-get remove certbot



step 3.
- Install certbot on the server through the command 

Sudo snap install --classic certbot

step 4. 
- the command below will ensure certbot is installed and can be ran.

sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot


sudo certbot --apache


- Inside this step there is additional information needed to be entered during the executiion of certbot.
- This includes
- ensuring you have read and confirmed the terms of service.

Y

- Asking if you want to subscribe to their email list

Y

- Then you need to enter the domain name you would like to get the certificate on
- In my instance, the domain name i entered is shown below

34011878.hopto.org

- After this you have successfully installed the HTTPS certificate for your domain name.

Step5.
- Test if the automatic certbot certificate renewal service works.

sudo certbot renew --dry-run

Step 6.
- Confirm on your domain name that the certificate worked.
- Look for the padlock, and check that the website loads using https:// instead of http://
